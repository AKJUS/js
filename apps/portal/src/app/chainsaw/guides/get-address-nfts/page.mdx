# Tutorial: Fetching NFTs Owned by a Wallet Address

This comprehensive tutorial will guide you through the process of using thirdweb Chainsaw to fetch NFTs owned by a specific wallet address. We'll cover the setup, authentication, and implementation steps with complete code snippets.

## Step 1: Setup

First, you need to install the thirdweb Chainsaw package. Choose your preferred package manager:

<InstallTabs
	npm="npm i @thirdweb-dev/chainsaw"
	yarn="yarn add @thirdweb-dev/chainsaw"
	pnpm="pnpm i @thirdweb-dev/chainsaw"
/>

## Step 2: Authentication

Before using the Chainsaw SDK, you need to authenticate. Follow these steps to obtain a client ID:

1. Sign up or log in to the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Navigate to the API Keys section and create a new API key.
4. Copy the client ID for use in your code.

## Step 3: Implement NFT Fetching

Now, let's write the code to fetch NFTs owned by a specific wallet address:

```typescript
 @param {GetNFTsByOwnerParams} params
 @returns {Promise<GetNFTsByOwnerResult>}

 ---
 import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
 import { getNFTsByOwner } from "thirdweb/chainsaw";

 const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId: "..." });
 const startDate = new Date(Date.now() - 48 * 60 * 60_000);
 const endDate = new Date(Date.now() - 24 * 60 * 60_000);
 const nfts = await getNFTsByOwner({
  client,
  ownerAddresses: ["0x..."],
  chainIds: [1],
  pageSize: 20,
  page: 1
 });
```
