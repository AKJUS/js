# Chainsaw


Chainsaw is a powerful blockchain data indexing and querying solution designed to simplify access to on-chain information. It provides developers with an efficient way to retrieve and analyze blockchain data, enabling the creation of more robust and data-driven decentralized applications.

## Motivation

As blockchain ecosystems grow more complex, accessing and interpreting on-chain data becomes increasingly challenging. Chainsaw addresses this challenge by offering a streamlined approach to data retrieval, allowing developers to focus on building innovative applications rather than wrestling with complex data extraction processes.

## Functionality

Chainsaw offers a comprehensive set of features for blockchain data interaction:

- **Block Information**: Retrieve detailed information about specific blocks.
- **Event Tracking**: Fetch and analyze blockchain events based on various parameters.
- **Transaction Details**: Access comprehensive transaction data for in-depth analysis.
- **NFT Data**: Query NFT ownership and collection information across different chains.
- **Real-time Updates**: Get the latest block numbers for up-to-date information.

## Usage

Chainsaw can be easily integrated into your projects using our TypeScript SDK or by directly accessing our API endpoints. 
Here's a quick example using the TypeScript SDK:

```typescript

  import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
  import { getTransactions } from "thirdweb/chainsaw";

  const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId: "..." });
  const startDate = new Date(Date.now() - 24 * 60 * 60_000);
  const endDate = new Date();
  const block = await getTransactions({
   client,
   to: "0x...",
   chainIds: [1],
   startDate,
   endDate,
   pageSize: 20,
   page: 1
  });
```
