# Anthentication


## API Authentication

To authenticate your requests to the Chainsaw API, you need to obtain an API key from the thirdweb dashboard. 
Once you have your API key, you can use it to authenticate your requests using one of the following methods:

1. Header Authentication:
   You can include your API key in the request headers using one of these options:
   - `x-secret-key`: Your API secret key
   - `x-client-id`: Your client ID
   - `x-bundle-id`: Your bundle ID

   Example:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://chainsaw.thirdweb.com/v2/events" \
     -H "Host: api.thirdweb.com" \
     -H "x-secret-key: your_api_key_here"
   ```

2. Query Parameter Authentication:
   Alternatively, you can include your API key as a query parameter in your request URL:
   - `bundleId`: Your bundle ID

   Example:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://api.thirdweb.com/v2/events?bundleId=your_bundle_id_here"
   ```

3. JWT Authentication:
   For enhanced security, you can use JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication. Generate a JWT token using your API key and include it in the `Authorization` header of your request.

   Example:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://api.thirdweb.com/v2/events" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token_here"
   ```

To ensure the security of your API key, always use HTTPS for your requests and never share your API key publicly or include it in client-side code.


## SDK Authentication

To authenticate using the Chainsaw SDK, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary function:
   In your TypeScript or JavaScript file, import the `createThirdwebClient` function:

   ```typescript
   import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
   ```

2. Create a client instance:
   Use the `createThirdwebClient` function to create an authenticated client instance. You'll need to provide your client ID, which you can obtain from the thirdweb dashboard:

   ```typescript
   const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId: "your-client-id-here" });
   ```

   Replace `"your-client-id-here"` with your actual client ID.

3. Use the client for authenticated calls:
   Once you have created the client instance, you can use it to make authenticated calls to Chainsaw. For example:

   ```typescript
   import { getTransactions } from "thirdweb/chainsaw";

   const transactions = await getTransactions({
     client,
     // ... other parameters
   });
   ```

4. Best practices:
   - Store your client ID securely, preferably in environment variables.
   - Never expose your client ID in client-side code or public repositories.
   - Use appropriate error handling when making API calls.

By following these steps, you'll be able to authenticate and use the Chainsaw SDK in your applications securely and efficiently.
